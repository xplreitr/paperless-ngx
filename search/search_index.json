This matching algorithm tries to assign tags, correspondents, document types, and storage paths to your documents based on how you have already assigned these on existing documents. It uses a neural network under the hood.</p> <p>If, for example, all your bank statements of your account 123 at the Bank of America are tagged with the tag \"bofa123\" and the matching algorithm of this tag is set to Auto, this neural network will examine your documents and automatically learn when to assign this tag.</p> <p>Paperless tries to hide much of the involved complexity with this approach. However, there are a couple caveats you need to keep in mind when using this feature:</p> <ul> <li>Changes to your documents are not immediately reflected by the   matching algorithm. The neural network needs to be trained on your   documents after changes. Paperless periodically (default: once each   hour) checks for changes and does this automatically for you.</li> <li>The Auto matching algorithm only takes documents into account which   are NOT placed in your inbox (i.e. have any inbox tags assigned to   them). This ensures that the neural network only learns from   documents which you have correctly tagged before.</li> <li>The matching algorithm can only work if there is a correlation   between the tag, correspondent, document type, or storage path and   the document itself. Your bank statements usually contain your bank   account number and the name of the bank, so this works reasonably   well, However, tags such as \"TODO\" cannot be automatically   assigned.</li> <li>The matching algorithm needs a reasonable number of documents to   identify when to assign tags, correspondents, storage paths, and   types. If one out of a thousand documents has the correspondent   \"Very obscure web shop I bought something five years ago\", it will   probably not assign this correspondent automatically if you buy   something from them again. The more documents, the better.</li> <li>Paperless also needs a reasonable amount of negative examples to   decide when not to assign a certain tag, correspondent, document   type, or storage path. This will usually be the case as you start   filling up paperless with documents. Example: If all your documents   are either from \"Webshop\" or \"Bank\", paperless will assign one   of these correspondents to ANY new document, if both are set to   automatic matching.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"advanced_usage/#consume-hooks","title":"Hooking into the consumption process","text":"<p>Sometimes you may want to do something arbitrary whenever a document is consumed.

Do not configure this to use   SQLite instead. Also configure port, database name, user and   password as necessary.</li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_CONSUMPTION_DIR</code> should point to a folder which   paperless should watch for documents. You might want to have   this somewhere else. Likewise, <code>PAPERLESS_DATA_DIR</code> and   <code>PAPERLESS_MEDIA_ROOT</code> define where paperless stores its data.   If you like, you can point both to the same directory.</li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_SECRET_KEY</code> should be a random sequence of   characters. It's used for authentication. Failure to do so   allows third parties to forge authentication credentials.</li> <li><code>PAPERLESS_URL</code> if you are behind a reverse proxy. This should   point to your domain. Please see   configuration for more   information.</li> <p>Many more adjustments can be made to paperless, especially the OCR part.

For this you need to uncomment the <code>Require=paperless-webserver.socket</code> in the <code>webserver</code> script and configure <code>gunicorn</code> to listen on port 80 (see <code>paperless/gunicorn.conf.py</code>).</p> <p>You may need to adjust the path to the <code>gunicorn</code> executable. This will be installed as part of the python dependencies, and is either located in the <code>bin</code> folder of your virtual environment, or in <code>~/.local/bin/</code> if no virtual environment is used.</p> <p>These services rely on redis and optionally the database server, but don't need to be started in any particular order. The example files depend on redis being started. If you use a database server, you should add additional dependencies.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>The included scripts run a <code>gunicorn</code> standalone server, which is fine for running paperless. It does support SSL, however, the documentation of GUnicorn states that you should use a proxy server in front of gunicorn instead.</p> <p>For instructions on how to use nginx for that, see the wiki.</p> <p>Warning</p> <p>If celery won't start (check with <code>sudo systemctl status paperless-task-queue.service</code> for paperless-task-queue.service and paperless-scheduler.service ) you need to change the path in the files. Example: <code>ExecStart=/opt/paperless/.local/bin/celery --app paperless worker --loglevel INFO</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Optional: Install a samba server and make the consumption folder     available as a network share.</p> </li> <li> <p>Configure ImageMagick to allow processing of PDF documents. Most     distributions have this disabled by default, since PDF documents can     contain malware. If you don't do this, paperless will fall back to     ghostscript for certain steps such as thumbnail generation.</p> <p>Edit <code>/etc/ImageMagick-6/policy.xml</code> and adjust</p> <pre><code>&lt;policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"none\" pattern=\"PDF\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>to</p> <pre><code>&lt;policy domain=\"coder\" rights=\"read|write\" pattern=\"PDF\" /&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Optional: Install the     jbig2enc     encoder. This will reduce the size of generated PDF documents.     You'll most likely need to compile this by yourself, because this     software has been patented until around 2017 and binary packages are     not available for most distributions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optional: If using the NLTK machine learning processing (see     <code>PAPERLESS_ENABLE_NLTK</code> for details),     download the NLTK data for the Snowball     Stemmer, Stopwords and Punkt tokenizer to your     <code>PAPERLESS_DATA_DIR/nltk</code>.

However, it is up to you to use them in a way that helps you organize documents and find specific documents when you need them. This section offers a couple ideas for managing your collection.</p> <p>Document types allow you to classify documents according to what they are. You can define types such as \"Receipt\", \"Invoice\", or \"Contract\". If you used to collect all your receipts in a single binder, you can recreate that system in paperless by defining a document type, assigning documents to that type and then filtering by that type to only see all receipts.</p> <p>Not all documents need document types. Sometimes its hard to determine what the type of a document is or it is hard to justify creating a document type that you only need once or twice. This is okay. As long as the types you define help you organize your collection in the way you want, paperless is doing its job.</p> <p>Tags can be used in many different ways. Think of tags are more versatile folders or binders. If you have a binder for documents related to university / your car or health care, you can create these binders in paperless by creating tags and assigning them to relevant documents. Just as with documents, you can filter the document list by tags and only see documents of a certain topic.</p> <p>With physical documents, you'll often need to decide which folder the document belongs to. The advantage of tags over folders and binders is that a single document can have multiple tags. A physical document cannot magically appear in two different folders, but with tags, this is entirely possible.</p> <p>Tip</p> <p>This can be used in many different ways. One example: Imagine you're working on a particular task, such as signing up for university. Usually you'll need to collect a bunch of different documents that are already sorted into various folders. With the tag system of paperless, you can create a new group of documents that are relevant to this task without destroying the already existing organization. When you're done with the task, you could delete the tag again, which would be equal to sorting documents back into the folder they belong into. Or keep the tag, up to you.</p> <p>All of the logic above applies to correspondents as well. Attach them to documents if you feel that they help you organize your collection.</p> <p>When you've started organizing your documents, create a couple saved views for document collections you regularly access. This is equal to having labeled physical binders on your desk, except that these saved views are dynamic and simply update themselves as you add documents to the system.</p> <p>Here are a couple examples of tags and types that you could use in your collection.</p> <ul> <li>An <code>inbox</code> tag for newly added documents that you haven't manually   edited yet.</li> <li>A tag <code>car</code> for everything car related (repairs, registration,   insurance, etc)</li> <li>A tag <code>todo</code> for documents that you still need to do something with,   such as reply, or perform some task online.</li> <li>A tag <code>bank account x</code> for all bank statement related to that   account.</li> <li>A tag <code>mail</code> for anything that you added to paperless via its mail   processing capabilities.</li> <li>A tag <code>missing_metadata</code> when you still need to add some metadata to   a document, but can't or don't want to do this right now.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"usage/#basic-usage_searching","title":"Searching","text":"<p>Paperless offers an extensive searching mechanism that is designed to allow you to quickly find a document you're looking for (for example, that thing that just broke and you bought a couple months ago, that contract you signed 8 years ago).</p> <p>When you search paperless for a document, it tries to match this query against your documents. Paperless will look for matching documents by inspecting their content, title, correspondent, type and tags. Paperless returns a scored list of results, so that documents matching your query better will appear further up in the search results.</p> <p>By default, paperless returns only documents which contain all words typed in the search bar. However, paperless also offers advanced search syntax if you want to drill down the results further.</p> <p>Matching documents with logical expressions:</p> <pre><code>shopname AND (product1 OR product2)\n</code></pre> <p>Matching specific tags, correspondents or types:</p> <pre><code>type:invoice tag:unpaid\ncorrespondent:university certificate\n</code></pre> <p>Matching dates:</p> <pre><code>created:[2005 to 2009]\nadded:yesterday\nmodified:today\n</code></pre> <p>Matching inexact words:</p> <pre><code>produ*name\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>Inexact terms are hard for search indexes. These queries might take a while to execute. That's why paperless offers auto complete and query correction.</p> <p>All of these constructs can be combined as you see fit.
